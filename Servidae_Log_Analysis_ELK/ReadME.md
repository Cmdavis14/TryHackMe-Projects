# Servidae: Log Analysis in ELK

## Overview
This folder documents my completion of the *Servidae: Log Analysis in ELK* module on TryHackMe. This exercise provided hands-on experience with the Elastic Stack (ELK) for log ingestion, analysis, and threat detection, simulating real-world scenarios in security monitoring.

## Objective
To use ELK (Elastic Stack) to analyze logs for potential security threats, practice creating visualizations, and configure alerts for suspicious activities.

## Skills Learned
- **Log Parsing and Ingestion**: Leveraging Logstash to parse and index logs in Elasticsearch.
- **Data Querying and Filtering**: Using Kibana to query, filter, and analyze log data.
- **Alerting and Threat Detection**: Setting up alerts in Kibana to identify and monitor suspicious patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating dashboards for better visibility into log data and trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Elastic Stack (ELK)**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- **Platform**: TryHackMe (*Servidae* module)

## Key Steps
1. **Log Ingestion with Logstash**: Configured Logstash to parse incoming logs and index them in Elasticsearch for easy querying.
2. **Exploring Data in Kibana**: Utilized Kibana's search and filter capabilities to analyze log entries and identify unusual activities.
3. **Setting Alerts**: Configured alerts based on log patterns to simulate a real-world threat detection scenario.
4. **Building Dashboards**: Designed visual dashboards in Kibana to monitor log data effectively and quickly spot issues.

## Reflection
Completing this module enhanced my ability to perform log analysis and threat detection using the ELK stack. The hands-on approach deepened my understanding of ELKâ€™s capabilities in security monitoring, particularly in visualizing and proactively managing log data.
